       Extract the meta information from a Digital Speech Standard (DSS) file.
       DSS is a compact file format used for recording voice.  It is used in
       Olympus Digital Voice Recorders.

       To be precise, I assume it is used all over, but I _know_ that it is
       used in the Olympus DS-330 Digital Voice Recorder.

       My voice recorder supports five different folders, and many different
       tracks in each folder.  The interface software then sucks my recordings
       from the voice recorder onto my iBook, putting clips into individual
       dss files in one of five different directories.

       The DSS header includes the time a track was created, when it was last
       edited, the total time, and up to 100 characters of comments.  The key
       use case for this module is to pull time stamps then use the as yet
       unwritten and not really named 'Geo::Track::Interpolate' to syncronize
       DSS files with GPS track logs based on the time stamps.

       Huh?  Time is the universal foreign key!  If you know what time some-
       thing occurred then you can syncronize it with your GPS track log.
       Digital photos, voice records, heart rate monitoring, temperature, ran-
       dom stuff, etc.

       Double huh?  Syncronizing 'media' (Schuyler thinks these are all media,
       and I get wierded out by that language so put it in scare quotes) with
       position, or 'geocoding the media' is the key component of Quantitative
       Psychogeography.  This is the quantitative study of spaces and our
       relationships with those spaces.  Among other things.

       As an aside, or intercalery, how much POD do I need to write for this
       module before my code to pod ratio exceeds all known limits?

       EEXXPPOORRTT

       None by default.

       See http://www.mappinghacks.com, which might be cool.  http://loca-
       tive.us is another site of potential interest.  http://geocoder.us is a
       US Geocoder written by Schuyler Erle.

       You should 'probably' think about using the GPX format if you want to
       share these tracks with other people.
